### Analysis

- In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
A bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen .

A pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice .
A scatter plot shows  mouse weight vs. the average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen.

The correlation coefficient and linear regression model are calculated for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
